Many believe that comments are useless if the code is solid enough. The idea is that when everything is well designed, the code itself documents what the code is doing, hence code comments are superfluous.

1. Many comments don't explain what the code is doing. They explain what you can't understand just from what the code does. Often this missing information is *why* the code is doing a certain action, or why itâ€™s doing something that is clear instead of something else that would feel more natural.

2. While it is not generally useful to document, line by line, what the code is doing, because it is understandable just by reading it, a key goal in writing readable code is to lower the amount of effort and the number of details the reader should take into her or his head while reading some code. So comments can be, for me, a tool for lowering the cognitive load of the reader.
