```
a: [1 2 3] 
b: a
b ;== [1 2 3]
```

![https]({{ "/assets/red-copy-1.png" | absolute_url }})

```
append a 4
a ;== [1 2 3 4]
b ;== [1 2 3 4]
```

It works like that for more complex objects that are allocated on the heap with a pointer, such as the block in the example. For simple types that are allocated in the stack, such as numbers and dates, each variable gets its own value storage:

```
a: 20 ;== 20
b: a  ;== 20
a: 25 ;== 25
b     ;== 20
```

If you don't want this behavior, you have to do `b: copy a`, instead of `b: a` as shown here:
```
a: [1 2 3]
b: copy a
b ;== [1 2 3]
append a 4
a ;== [1 2 3 4]
b ;== [1 2 3]
```
