  header [block!]          "Optional. Contents must be one of [set-word! string!]"
  data   [string! binary!] "Optional"

   Server: "gunicorn/19.8.1"
   Content-Type: "application/json"
   Content-Length: "285"
   Connection: "close"
   Date: "Wed, 11 Jul 2018 06:43:49 GMT"
   Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: "true"
 )
 {
   {"args":{},"headers":{"Connection":"close","Content-Type":"application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8","Host":"httpbin.org","User-Agent":"console-2017-8-3-49893 (unknown version) CFNetwork/901.1 Darwin/17.6.0 (x86_64)"},"origin":"116.100.220.206","url":"http://httpbin.org/get"}^/
