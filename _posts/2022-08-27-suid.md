## UUID

- 128 bits of randomness (36 characters)
- UUID v1/v2 requires access to a unique, stable MAC address
- UUID v3/v5 requires a unique seed and produces randomly distributed IDs
- UUID v4 provides no other information than randomness


## MongoDBâ€™s ObjectId

[ObjectId](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/ObjectId/)

The 12-byte ObjectId consists of:
- A 4-byte timestamp, representing the ObjectId's creation, measured in seconds since the Unix epoch.
- A 5-byte random value generated once per process. This random value is unique to the machine and process.
- A 3-byte incrementing counter, initialized to a random value.


## Twitter Snowflake (archive)

[Snowflake](https://github.com/twitter-archive/snowflake/tree/snowflake-2010) is a network service for generating unique ID numbers at high scale

- Time Ordered
- under 64bits
- id is composed of:
  + time - 41 bits (millisecond precision w/ a custom epoch gives us 69 years)
  + configured machine id - 10 bits - gives us up to 1024 machines
  + sequence number - 12 bits - rolls over every 4096 per machine (with protection to avoid rollover in the same ms)


## Instagram IDs

[Sharding & IDs at Instagram](https://instagram-engineering.com/sharding-ids-at-instagram-1cf5a71e5a5c)

Delegate ID creation to each table inside each shard, by using PL/PGSQL.

Each of IDs consists of:

- 41 bits for time in milliseconds (gives us 41 years of IDs with a custom epoch)
- 13 bits that represent the logical shard ID
- 10 bits that represent an auto-incrementing sequence, modulus 1024. This means we can generate 1024 IDs, per shard, per millisecond


## ksuid

[K-Sortable Unique IDentifier](https://github.com/segmentio/ksuid)

- Time Ordered
- Binary KSUIDs are 20-bytes:
  + a 32-bit unsigned integer UTC timestamp. The timestamp epoch is adjusted to May 13th, 2014, providing over 100 years of life.
  + a 128-bit randomly generated payload.
- The text representation is always 27 characters, encoded in alphanumeric `base62` that will lexicographically sort by timestamp.

```sh
# generate a KSUID and inspect its components
$ ksuid -f inspect

## ulid

[https://github.com/ulid/spec](https://github.com/ulid/spec)

- Lexicographically sortable
- Canonically encoded as a 26 character string, uses `Crockford's base32` (case insensitive)
- 128-bit:
  + Timestamp: 48 bit integer, UNIX-time in milliseconds. Won't run out of space 'til the year 10889 AD.
  + Randomness: 80 bits. Cryptographically secure source of randomness, if possible
