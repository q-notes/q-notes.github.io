```clj
(defprotocol Foo
  "Foo doc string"
  (bar [this b] "bar doc string")
  (baz [this] [this b] "baz doc string"))

; extend exiting String type
(extend-protocol Foo String
  (bar [this param] (println this param)))

(bar "hello" "world")
=>"hello world"

; define type/record & impl Protocol
(deftype Bar [data] Foo
  (bar [this param]
    (println data param))
  (baz [this]
    (println (class this)))
  (baz [this param]
    (println param)))

(let [b (Bar. "some data")]
  (.bar b "param") ;=> some data param
  (.baz b) ;=> Bar
  (.baz b "baz with param") ;=> baz with param
)
```

- type vs. record vs. reify
  + defrecord: class implement protocol + map interface (clojure auto inject) ~> has immutable fields
  + deftype: class implement protocol without map-like features ~> has mutable fields
  + reify: anonymous class implement protocol ~> can't define fields

- record vs. map

  The only difference between a record+protocols and a map+functions is polymorphism. If you’re thinking "I need a record and protocols, but I don’t need polymorphism" then the solution is probably a map plus functions.
