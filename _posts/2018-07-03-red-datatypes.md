> Expression of information is not just about structure. It's not just about name-value pairs. It's also about the datatypes as values and the ability to handle and manipulate those too.
>
> Meaning isn't just in strings, it's in the full expression itself. A holistic representation. The REBOL form includes set-words, words, strings, dates, and blocks - lexically cleaner, less syntax, as well.
>
> Unfortunately, many programmers don't think outside of the box. They're stuck in a narrow world of strings and unnecessary punctuation.
>
> The mind is naturally capable and comfortable with so much more. Use it.
